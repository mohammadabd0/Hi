# Functions
A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. 
 * To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.


 ## Defining functions

* The name of the function.
* A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
* The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}.

 ## For example
 function square(number) {
  return number * number;
}

### Control flow
The control flow is the order in which the computer executes. Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line

A typical script in JavaScript or PHP (and the like) includes many control structures, including conditionals, loops and functions. Parts of a script may also be set to execute when events occur.


### JavaScript Operators

* let x = 5;         // assign the value 5 to x
* let y = 2;         // assign the value 2 to y
* let z = x + y;     // assign the value 7 to z (5 + 2)
