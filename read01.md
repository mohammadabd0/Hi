## Summary
Markdown is a web-based text editing tool. You have complete control over how the document looks,
bolding or italicizing words, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. 
Markdown is mostly just plain text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in for good measure the interesting features 
that most of the other engines don't have, such as inline attribute lists (IALs), which enable easy styling beyond the standard Markdown options.

### Examples 
* Text
* Lists 
* Images 
* Headers
